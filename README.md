# SOLVE ATTENDANCE ISSUES AT AMERICAN WING, THE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI.
***
## Student attendance at the Engineering school faces a lot of issues: 
<br>
                ~Students signing for students who are not in school
<br>
                ~Lectures getting the wrong impression on attendance 
<br>
                ~Discreancies between the attendance and results
***

-> So in this repository I try to come up with logical ways that can be used to prevent such activities from happening.
-> Manual signing can be burdensome and inaccurate, so I think of an automatic system that keeps a track of students attendance and sends it to the lecturers.
-> The system consists of a scanner that students scan their thumbprints on entering the class and after and it calculates the number of hours a student has been in class. The list is automatically sent to the lecturer
***
The step-wise logic of the program is as follows:
## 1. Hardware Setup
## 2. Database Setup
## 3. Attendance software
## 4. Attendance Calculation
## 5. Integration with Student Portal
## 6. Attendance Reporting for Instructors
## 7. Security and Compliance
## 8. Testing and Training
